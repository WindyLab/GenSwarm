The robots need to be evenly distributed along a circle with a one-unit radius, centered on the prey.
Each robot is assigned a specific angle.
As the prey moves, the robots must continuously adjust their positions in real-time, responding to the prey's dynamic changes.
This ensures a sustained and coordinated encirclement.
