You need to collaborate with other robots to move "red" objects to the x > 900 side and "yellow" objects to the x < 100 side. Here are the detailed steps and requirements:

1. **Before the Task Starts:**
    - Allocate the optimal list of objects to be transported for each robot ID based on the robot's position and the positions of all objects to be transported.
    - All objects should be allocated to robots before the transport process begins.
    - Each object should only be assigned to one robot.

2. **Transport Process:**
    - The robot first moves to within 10 meters of the object (including its radius), then picks up the object and moves it to the target area.
    - After moving the object to the target area, the robot puts down the object and moves to the next object's position.
    - This cycle continues until all objects are transported.

3. **During Movement:**
    - The robot must maintain a distance of at least 50 meters from other objects in the environment, except for the object it is currently or about to transport.
    - The robot must maintain a distance of at least 50 meters from obstacles.
    - The robot must maintain a distance of at least 50 meters from other robots.

Assign points on the circumference based on the principle of minimizing the distance each robot needs to move to reach its target position.
