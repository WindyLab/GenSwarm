## Background:
{task_des}

## Role setting:
-It's now the phase to run the code, your task is to find the erroneous part based on the compiler's traceback feedback, and modify it.

## These are the User original instructions:
{instruction}

## These are the environment description:
{env_des}


## These are the basic Robot APIs:
```python
{robot_api}
```
## These are the functions that mentioned in the error message:
{mentioned_functions}

## These are the error messages:
{error_message}

## Task
According to the error message, make modifications based on the existing foundation, and output the modified function in its entirety.
The output TEXT format is as follows:
Reasoning: what caused the error, and how did you fix it? Provide serval fixes and choose the best one.
code:
```python
import ...(if necessary else remove this line)


function_name(...):
    ...


...
```

## Notes:
- Only allowed to modify errors, not allowed to modify function names as well as the input and output of the function.
- Output the complete code of the entire function, not just a part of it that's been omitted.
- Rewrite all functions that need modifications.
- Keep the original code in the function as unchanged as possible, only modifying the parts that are incorrect.
- The provided basic Robot APIs have already been implemented. You cannot modify these functions; you can only call them.
- The output should be in the specified format.

## Task
According to the error message, make modifications based on the existing foundation, and output the modified function in its entirety.
The output TEXT format is as follows:
Reasoning:Why the previous modifications did not work? what caused the error, and how did you fix it? Provide serval fixes and choose the best one.

FEEDBACK_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
## Background:
{task_des}

## These are the User original instructions:
{instruction}

## Role setting:
- After running the code, there are some issues. You need to modify based on the feedback from users.

## These are the environment description:
{env_des}


## These are the basic Robot APIs:
There are two types of APIs: local and global.
where local APIs can only be called by the robot itself, and global APIs can be called by an centralized allocator.

### local APIs:
```python
{local_api}
```

### global APIs:
```python
{global_api}
```

## These are the functions that can be modified:
There are two types of functions: local and global.
where local functions can only be called by the robot itself, and global functions can be called by an centralized allocator.

### local functions:
```python
{local_functions}
```

### global functions:
```python
{global_functions}
```

## These are the user's feedback:
{feedback}

## Output format:
### Reasoning: you should analyze in the step:
    - What is the problem?
    - Which part of the code is problematic?
    - Any global functions that need modification?
    - Any local functions that need modification?
    - What is the solution?
### Code:
```python
function_name(...):
    import ...(if necessary)
    ...
# possible other functions
...
```
## Notes:
- Do not modify the function name.
- The input and output of the function could be modified.But you should make sure other functions that call this function can still work.
- Global functions can't call local functions,and local functions can't call global functions.
- If any third-party libraries are needed, you can import them in the function.Don't import them outside the function.
- Apis and written functions can be called directly.
- Output the complete code of the entire function, not just a part of it that's been omitted.
- Don't create new functions.
- Only output the functions that need modification, with as few changes as possible.
- Rewrite all functions that need modifications.
- Keep the original code in the function as unchanged as possible, only modifying the parts that are incorrect.
- The output should be in the specified format.
