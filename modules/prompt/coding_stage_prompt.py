## Background:

## Role setting:
- Your task is to complete this predefined function according to the description.

## These are the environment description:
These are the basic descriptions of the environment.
{env_des}

## These are GLOBAL APIs:
```python
{robot_api}
```

## These are the functions you can call directly even if they are not implemented now:
```python
{other_functions}
```

## These are the constraints that need to be satisfied in the implementation of the function:
{constraints}

## Task
Complete the following function. The output TEXT format is as follows:
### Reasoning: (reason step by step about how to implement this function.)
### Code:
```python
import ...(if necessary)
{function_content}
    ...(function body,you need to complete it)
```
## Notes:
- The global API and existing functions can be called directly without the need for imports.
- Generate bug-free, directly invocable function code according to Google's coding standards.
- The use of “raise error” and "assert" is strictly prohibited; when an issue arises, it must be resolved within the function without raising an error or using assertions.
- Adjustable parameters should be taken as input parameters with default values set for each parameter.
- You can only write functions according to the task's specified format, and cannot generate other helper functions. If necessary, define sub-functions within the specified function.
- Take a holistic approach and reuse **existing functions as much as possible**; this function is just a part of the entire control system.
- Avoid using global variables, and do not use variable names that conflict with global variables within the function.
- Preserve the function's docstring but modify its content if necessary, ensuring the function name remains unchanged.
- Do not use while loops or raise exceptions in the function body.
- If the function definition or docstring needs modification, ensure the function name stays the same.
- Import required modules before the function name, not within the function body.
- The robot allocation method should be optimal, avoiding conflicts between robots.
- Task allocation will only occur once at the start of the task. The tasks assigned to each robot should take environmental changes into account and avoid relying on any single changing object.
- The task allocation can include various types such as positions, lists of positions, or specific angles, based on the requirements of the task.

- Import required modules before the function name, not within the function body.
- If the function outputs velocity, the velocity must be normalized.
- The current task does not necessarily require a global allocator. If needed, use the appropriate API to obtain the assigned task. If no such API exists, the task does not require a global allocator.
- Ensure that the generated function meets all constraints.

You need to write an interface function that calls the existing global function to assign appropriate strategies to each robot.

## These are the basic global APIs:

Complete the following function. The output TEXT format is as follows:
### Reasoning: (reason step by step about how to implement this function.)
### Code:

        None

         - value: any data type, e.g. tuple, list,float etc., decided by the task type.

## Notes:
- The API and existing functions can be called directly without the need imports.
- You need to generate bug-free, directly invocable function code according to Google's coding standards.
- You can only complete the functions specified in Task according to the specified format; you cannot generate other Helper functions. If necessary, you can define functions within this function.
- You can only call these existing functions and global Api, and you cannot define complex logic on your own,just call the existing functions.
- Import the required modules before the function name, and do not import them in the function body.
- Use the existing high-level functions.
- Do not use while loops or raise exceptions in the function body.
- The allocation method for robots should be optimal, ensuring no conflicts occur between them.
- Task allocation will only occur once at the beginning of the task, so the tasks assigned to each robot should take environmental changes into account and avoid relying on any single changing object.
- The task allocation can include various types such as positions, lists of positions, or specific angles, based on the requirements of the task.
- You should populate the output format based on the code you've written, as this output format will impact the code development for the Robots.
- Ensure that this function can be executed to completion and is able to return the expected output.
- Strictly follow the specified format.

- Use time.sleep to limit the loop frequency, and robot control should be executed at a frequency of 100Hz.
