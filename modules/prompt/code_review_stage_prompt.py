CODE_REVIEW_PROMPT_TEMPLATE: str = """
## Background:
{task_des}
## Role setting:
- You are a critic, and you need to check whether the given function meets certain constraints.

## These are the basic Robot APIs:
These APIs can be directly called by you.
```python
{robot_api}
```

## These are the existing functions that you can directly call:
```python
{other_functions}
```

## This is the constraint that the function should satisfy:
{constraints}

## These are the functions that need to be checked:
```python
{functions}
```

## The output TEXT format is as follows:
 
**Reasoning**: if satisfied, why? For each function, you need to provide a reason. If not satisfied, how to improve it?
**Satisfaction**: True/False.Choose one of them.
**Modified function**:
```python
put the modified function here
```

## Notes:
Your output should satisfy the following notes:
- Check whether the function meets the constraints.
- Provide a reason for each function.
- If the function does not meet the constraints, provide a modified function.
- If the function meets the constraints, don't provide a modified function. 
- The output should strictly adhere to the specified format.
- In your answer, you can only use one True or False in a condition, and it's not allowed to be used elsewhere.
- The modified function section should be filled in only when the function does not meet the constraints.Otherwise, it should be empty.
- The modified function is not allowed to change the function name.
- The modified function absolutely must be complete and executable. You must provide a function that can be run directly, with absolutely no unfinished parts in the code.

HIGH_LEVEL_FUNCTION_REVIEW: str = """
## Background:
{task_des}
## Role setting:
- You are a critic, You should now check if there are any bugs in the functions written by other agents or if there have been any incorrect calls.

## These are the basic Robot APIs:
These APIs can be directly called by you.
```python
{robot_api}
```

## These are the existing functions that you can directly call:
```python
{other_functions}
```

## These are the functions that need to be checked:
```python
{function_content}
```

## The output TEXT format is as follows:

**Reasoning**: think step by step, whether the to be checked function has any bugs or incorrect calls. If there are any,provide how to fix it.
**Modified function**:(if the function has bugs or incorrect calls else it should not appear,only output the Reasoning part)
```python
import ... (import the necessary modules,if any)
def {function_name}(...):
    # put the modified function here
```

## Notes:
Your output should satisfy the following notes:
- Carefully check if there are any bugs in this function, or if there are any logical inconsistencies.
- Check if the call to each sub-function is correct.
- Strictly adhere to the specified format.
- The modified function section should be filled in only when the function has bugs or incorrect calls. Otherwise, this section should not appear.
- If the function needs to be rewritten, please ensure that the rewritten function name is {function_name}.
- If you need to rewrite a function, please output the complete and correct function, and only modify the parts that are incorrect.
- You should carefully consider and ensure that your revised version is correct.
- If there is an error in this function, please provide the erroneous line of code in the "reasoning" section, along with suggestions for how it could be corrected.
