Common Sense:
- "Flocking" refers to the behavior seen in nature, such as birds flying together or fish swimming in a school, where each individual moves in coordination with its neighbors to form a cohesive group without a centralized control. The robots should autonomously adjust their positions and velocities to move as a group around the designated point while maintaining a formation that allows for cohesive movement without collisions.
