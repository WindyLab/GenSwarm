DesignFunction_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
## Task description:
In order to assist users in automating specific tasks, you need to design a series of decoupled Python functions based on user functional requirements and constraints.

## User functional requirements:
{analysis}

## Constraints:
1. These functions should be decoupled from each other. 
2. Each function can utilize the existing APIs.
3. Each function should have strong reusability and should have a sufficient number of inputs and outputs.
4. Each function does not need to provide the content of the function body; just giving a `pass` is suffice.
5. Every function should provide a very detailed description of its functionality.

## Existing robot APIs:
These are the existing robot APIs, functions should try to reuse them as much as possible and refer to the design of them:
```python
{robot_api}
```

## These are the environment description:
{env_des}

## The generated result should be in the following fields:
function list: write the function list in the following format, 
```python
def function1(input1, input2, ...):
    ```
    Description: Detailed description of the function's functionality.
    Input: Description of the function's input.
    Returns: Description of the function's return value.
    ```
    pass
    
def function2(input1, input2, ...):
    ...
```

## The output TEXT format is as follows:
function list: <function list>
""".strip()

WriteSeqDiagram_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
## Task description:
Based on the user requirements document and current functions, you need to design a sequence diagram.

## User requirements: 
{analysis}

## These are the environment description:
{env_des}

## These are the basic Robot APIs:
```python
{robot_api}
```

## These are existing functions:
```python
{function_list}
```

## Explanation: 
1. The sequence diagram is to call the existing functions to fulfill the user's requirements.
2. The sequence diagram can be directly translated into Python code, which is capable of continuously monitoring the environment and outputting control signals at a certain frequency.
3. The code generated from the sequence diagram should not loop infinitely; it should be able to exit the loop once the task is completed.

## Constraints: 
1. You need to use these existing functions to generate a call flow diagram to fulfill the user's requirements.
2. You can't define any new functions.
3. Ensure that the sequence diagram translates directly into executable code that can accomplish the task objectives.

## The generated result should be in the following fields:
1. explanation: think step by step. How do you make the diagram conform to the algorithm?
2. sequence diagram: use Mermaid's sequenceDiagram to write sequence diagram, ```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n <your response>```

## The output TEXT format is as follows:
1. explanation: <explanation>
2. sequence diagram: <sequence diagram>
